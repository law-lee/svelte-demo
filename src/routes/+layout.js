// When the user navigates from one page to another, SvelteKit calls your load functions, but only if it thinks something has changed.
// In this example, navigating between timezones causes the load function in src/routes/[...timezone]/+page.js to re-run 
// because params.timezone is invalid. But the load function in src/routes/+layout.js does not re-run, because as far as 
// SvelteKit is concerned it wasnâ€™t invalidated by the navigation.
// We can fix that by manually invalidating it using the invalidate(...) function, which takes a URL and re-runs any load 
// functions that depend on it. Because the load function in src/routes/+layout.js calls fetch('/api/now'), it depends on /api/now.
// In src/routes/[...timezone]/+page.svelte, add an onMount callback that calls invalidate('/api/now') once a second:
export async function load({ fetch }) {
	const response = await fetch('/api/now');
	const now = await response.json();

	return {
		now,
        a: 1
	};
}
