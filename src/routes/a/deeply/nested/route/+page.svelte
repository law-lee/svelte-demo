<!--
Sometimes, code is used in multiple places. When this happens, itâ€™s useful to have a place to put them that can be accessed 
by all routes without needing to prefix imports with ../../../../. In SvelteKit, that place is the src/lib directory. 
Anything inside this directory can be accessed by any module in src via the $lib alias.
